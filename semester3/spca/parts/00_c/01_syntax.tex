\subsection{The Syntax}
\texttt{C} uses a very similar syntax as many other programming languages, like \texttt{Java}, \texttt{JavaScript} and many more\dots
to be precise, it is \textit{them} that use the \texttt{C} syntax, not the other way around. So:
\inputcodewithfilename{c}{code-examples/00_c/01_syntax/}{00_intro.c}
\inputcodewithfilename{c}{code-examples/00_c/01_syntax/}{01_func.h}
\inputcodewithfilename{c}{code-examples/00_c/01_syntax/}{01_func.c}
