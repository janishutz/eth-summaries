\subsection{The syntax}
There are two common styles: AT\&T syntax (common on UNIX) and Intel syntax (common on Windows)

The state that is visible to us is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item PC (Program Counter) that contains the address of the next instruction
    \item Register file that contains the most used program data
    \item Condition codes that store status information about most recent arithmetic operation and are used for conditional branching
\end{itemize}

To view what \lC\ code looks like in assembly, we can use \texttt{gcc -O0 -S code.c}, which produces \texttt{code.s} which contains assembly code.
