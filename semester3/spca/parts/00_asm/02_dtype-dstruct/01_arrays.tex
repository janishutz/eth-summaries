\subsubsection{Arrays}
Arrays of type \texttt{T} and length \texttt{L} are allocated as a contiguous region of memory with size \texttt{L * sizeof(T)} bytes.
We then also store a reference / identifier \texttt{A} to the array (i.e. similar to variable name in \lC), that holds the address of the first
element of the array and can then be used in conjunction with ``assembly pointer arithmetic''.

Array loops that are written as for-loops in code are usually transformed into do-while loops by the compiler to save one condition check in the beginning,
except of course, it might be possible that the loop is never executed.
