\subsubsection{Multi-Level arrays}
In comparison to multidimensional arrays, we have arrays of pointers that contain either more arrays of pointers, (normal) arrays or pointers to other data types.
The size of such a Multi-Level array is determined by:
\texttt{n * sizeof(ptr)}, where \texttt{sizeof(ptr)} is the platform-specific size of a pointer and \texttt{n} is the number of elements in the array

To do an access, we need to do two (or more) memory reads, which we can again do using address computations.

The benefit of these kinds of arrays is that we can store arbitrary data types together in an array, giving us more flexibility.
