\subsection{Control Flow}

Control flow structures from \verb|C| like \verb|if/else| or \verb|for| are compiled into assembly mainly using jumps and conditional \verb|move|.

By the nature of Assembly and thanks to compilers optimizing aggressively, there is no \textit{single} definitive translation of the \verb|C| control structures: The compiler may translate it very differently depending on the context of the program.

\subsubsection{Conditional statements}
A function using an \verb|if/else| construct to choose the maximum of $2$ numbers might compile like this:

\inputcodewithfilename{gas}{code-examples/01_asm/}{02_max.s}

A function computing the absolute difference $|x-y|$ using an \verb|if/else| construct, might use a conditional \verb|move| instead:

\inputcodewithfilename{gas}{code-examples/01_asm/}{03_absdiff.s}
