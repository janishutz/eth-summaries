\subsection{Floating Point}

Floating point numbers are a representation of real numbers. 

Though there are many ways to accomplish this, \textit{IEEE Standard 754} is used practically everywhere, also in \verb|x86|. This standard is a little more complicated than fractional binary numbers, but has a few numeric advantages, especially for representing very large (very small) numbers.

\hlhref{https://float.exposed}{float.exposed}\ is an excellent website to understand floating point by example.
