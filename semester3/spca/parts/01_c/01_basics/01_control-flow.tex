\subsubsection{Control Flow}
Many of the control-flow structures of \texttt{C} can be found in the below code snippet.
A note of caution when using goto: It is almost never a good idea (can lead to unexpected behaviour, is hard to maintain, etc).
Where it however is very handy is for error recovery (and cleanup functions) and early termination of multiple loops (jumping out of a loop).
So, for example, if you have to run multiple functions to set something up and one of them fails,
you can jump to a label and have all cleanup code execute that you have specified there.
And because the labels are (as in Assembly) skipped over during execution, you can make very nice cleanup code.
We can also use \texttt{continue} and \texttt{break} statements similarly to \texttt{Java}, they do not however accept labels.
(Reminder: \texttt{continue} skips the loop body and goes to the next iteration)
