\section{Introduction to C}
I can clearly C why you'd want to use C. Already sorry in advance for all the bad C jokes that are going to be part of this section

\texttt{C} is a compiled, low-level programming language, lacking many features modern high-level programming languages offer, like Object Oriented programming, true Functional Programming, Garbage Collection, complex abstract datatypes and vectors, just to name a few. (It is possible to replicate these, more on this later).

On the other hand, it offers the ability to directly integrate assembly code into the \texttt{.c} files, as well as bit level data manipulation and extensive memory management options, again just to name a few.

This of course leads to \texttt{C} performing excellently and there are many programming languages who's compiler doesn't directly produce machine code or assembly, but instead optimized \texttt{C} code that is then compiled into machine code using a \texttt{C} compiler.
This has a number of benefits, most notably that \texttt{C} compilers can produce very efficient assembly, as lots of effort is put into the \texttt{C} compilers by the hardware manufacturers.
