\section{Introduction}
This summary aims to provide a simple, easy to understand and short overview over the topics covered, with approaches for proofs, important theorems and lemmas,
as well as definitions.

It does not aim to serve as a full replacement for the book or my main summary, but as a supplement to both of them.

It also lacks some formalism and is only intended to give some intuition
