\subsection{Improper integrals}
As in the one-dimensional case, we are looking at integrals that are undefined at the edge of the interval and thus, we apply a limit to them,
thus approaching said edge of the interval.

For example, in the two-dimensional case, disc $D_R = [-R, R]^2$ with radius $R$

\begin{align*}
    \limit{R}{\infty} \int_{D_R} f(d, y) \dx x \dx y
\end{align*}
