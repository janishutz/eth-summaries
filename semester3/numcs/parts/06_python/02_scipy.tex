\subsection{Scipy}
Scipy is a library that, according to its website, provides ``Fundamental algorithms for scientific computing in Python''.
In this course it is primarily used for cases where Numpy either does not have an implementation or SciPy's implementation is faster.

Scipy needs Numpy arrays as inputs in most cases, thus not requiring any additional syntax.

You can find the scipy reference docs \hlhref{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/index.html}{here}
