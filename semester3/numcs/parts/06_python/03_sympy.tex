\subsection{Sympy}
\label{sec:sympy}
Sympy can be used to do symbolic operations, i.e. similar to what we would do in Analysis or the like.

You usually want to follow something like the below code:
\inputcode{python}{parts/06_python/03_sympy-ex.py}

It is also possible to compute the hessian and gradient using sympy (or also the jacobian):
\inputcode{python}{parts/06_python/03_sympy-hessian.py}
